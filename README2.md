# How to make _The Perfect Sandwich_
When the __Harley Quinn: Birds Of Prey__ came out in 2020, I was intrigued by the Sandwich shown in the movie. Fast forward A few days after the movie came out, [_Binging With Babish_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JFVKnrE_d8&ab_channel=BabishCulinaryUniverse) released a video on how to make aforementioned sandwich. <br> That video changed my life in a sense, because I started making me that sandwich for Breakfest every single day for a few years straight. <br> Today I will teach you how.
## ingredients
* __Bread__ - The movie doesn't mention a specific style of bread, but speculations around the internet say it is _Ciabatta_, specifically a _Ciabatta_ roll which is what we will go for.
* __Bacon__ - To make this authentic, we will need to source regular to thin bacon strips.
* __Cheese__ - As shown in the movie, American cheese is what we are looking for in this one.
* __Eggs__ - How many eggs to use is relative to the size of the _Ciabatta_ roll you have on hand. I would say a 6 inch roll is classic for 2 Eggs.
* __Hot Sauce__ After long research by critiques, it is said that the hot sauce used in the sandwich is probably ___Louisiana Crystal Hot Sauce___, or probably ___Trappey's Red Devil hot sauce___

## steps
1. First thing first, slice the bread evenly in half, and spread the inner part (the sliced one) with butter, preferably melted butter. <br>
Toast the buttered side until golden brown and crispy
> We are toasting only the inner side to keep the chewey texture of the _Ciabatta_ bread on the outside, but make sure the inside doesn't get soggy. 
>> Also, it is a great texture to add to the bite.
2. The __eggs__ in the movie are fried on a _Flat Top Grill_, so for those who do not have acces to one, I would advise using a Cast Iron, or Stainless Steel pan on a relatively high heat. The Eggs need to be cooked so they don't have A crispy bottom necessary, but the egg whites are springy. <br> When the eggs are almost donw, cover them with slices of the _American Cheese_ and preferably cover them so the Cheese would melt better. 
> Important note!: Make sure the Yolk is still runny, it is probably the most important parts of the _Sandwich_
3. __Bacon__ - Cook your Bacon on a skillet, a trick I use is starting with a cold skillet, that ensures the bacon is cooked slowly and evenly so it becomes as Crispy as i want it.
4. __Assembly__, order is important here, The bottom layer has to be bacon, after that put the eggs, and now the most important part. ___just a dash___of hot sauce on top, so we can taste the Cheese.
